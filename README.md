# LeagueSponsor üèÜ

-  [LeagueSponsor](https://leaguesponsor.oliviadavis593.vercel.app/) is a fully responsive full-stack React application designed for the LeagueSide company tech interview! The backend repo can be found [here](https://github.com/oliviadavis593/LeagueSponser-API).

## How to use the app üìì
Two options are possible in the application: Create a league or find leagues to sponsor. 

### Creating a league 
- All you have to do is put in the criteria it asks of you. 

#### Here are some leagues you can add to the form:
```
League Name: Detroit Tigers 
Latitude: 17
Longitude: 20
Website: https://www.mlb.com/tigers
Location: Detroit, Michigan
Price: 1250
```
```
League Name: Toronto Blue Jays
Latitude: 43
Longitude: 40
Website: https://www.mlb.com/bluejays
Location: Toronto, Canada
Price: 2500
```
```
League Name: Houston Astros 
Latitude: 13
Longitude: 15
Website: https://www.mlb.com/astros
Location: Houston, Texas
Price: 1500
```

### Finding a league to sponsor 
- For the data that is in the database I would suggest putting your search like so: 
```
1. Enter a total budget: this can range from 400-10000 dollars
2. Enter latitude: in progress...
3. Enter longitude: in progress...
4. Enter a radius: Only option for now is 5mi

```

## Wireframe üõ†
- I always start with a wireframe first approach before moving into planning the React component layout. This acutally aides in figuring out how my app will be layed out beforehand.
