# LeagueSponsor üèÜ

-  [LeagueSponsor](https://leaguesponsor.oliviadavis593.vercel.app/) is a fully responsive full-stack React application designed for the LeagueSide company tech interview! The backend repo can be found [here](https://github.com/oliviadavis593/LeagueSponser-API).

## How to use the app üìì
Two options are possible in the application: Create a league or find leagues to sponsor. 

### Creating a league 
- All you have to do is put in the criteria it asks of you. 

### Finding a league to sponsor 
- For the data that is in the database I would suggest looking for this 
```
1. Enter a total budget 
2. Enter latitude: in progress...
3. Enter longitude: in progress...
4. Enter a radius: Only option for now is 5mi

```

## Wireframe üõ†
- I always start with a wireframe first approach before moving into planning the React component layout. This acutally aides in figuring out how my app will be layed out beforehand.
